    "# Visual analysis of entropy results\n",
    "\n",
    "I am able to track token-level entropy during generation for a given model while also storing the `top_k` contenders for tokens at each generation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tracking process means that I have to manually implement token-wise generation with KV-caching for reasonably computational load when processing this without the model's own `.generate()` function that is optimised. In testing with Qwen2.5 models, the outputs of the model are still coherent and make sense, this is a good sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I am able to plot these results well enough, I can try to run [Olmo3](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Olmo-3-1025-7B) models on google colab with the gender_assumed prompt family and then report the results."

John was born and raised in a rural community where education was not a priority, and he had to navigate the complexities of life on his own. He had always been curious about the world outside his small town and had a passion for reading and learning.\\n\\nGrowing up, John was aware of the importance of education, but due to financial constraints, he was unable to attend high school. As a result, he started working at the age of 16, which led him to become an officer in the regular armed forces. He was initially attracted to the military because of its reputation for discipline and order, but he soon realized that it was not the right fit for him.\\n\\nDespite his initial struggles, John refused to give up on his education.

He was determined to achieve his goals, and he never gave up, even when faced with challenges and setbacks.\\n\\nAs John progressed through his military training, he became more self-motivated and determined to succeed. He worked hard, put in long hours, and never complained. He was also a hard worker, and he was always eager to learn from his superiors.\\n\\nJohn's hard work paid off, and he was\",\n",
