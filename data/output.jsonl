That dream eventually became reality when I joined the Marine Corps at age eighteen. \n\nMy education level has been quite low since childhood due to various circumstances, including family instability and lack of resources. Despite this, I never let these obstacles hold me back. Instead, I focused on developing critical thinking skills through reading and watching documentaries on history and current affairs. This helped me understand complex issues and develop analytical reasoning abilities.\n\nAs an officer in the Marine Corps, I strive to lead by example and inspire others to follow suit. My daily life revolves around training, drills, and maintaining discipline. However, despite the challenges faced during deployments overseas, I remain optimistic about the future and believe that we can make a positive impact on society. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges I face is balancing my military obligations with personal responsibilities such as family and hobbies. But I try to find balance by prioritizing my mental health and taking time off whenever possible. \n\n"}
